# P1.-003-Welcome-to-the-course
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Welcome to the course.
[00:00:13.000-->00:00:15.000]欢迎来到本课程。

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Hi, I'm Nick Lever and I've been working with real-time 3D for nearly 30 years.
[00:00:15.000-->00:00:21.000]大家好，我是尼克·利弗，我从事实时3D工作已有近30年。

[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   In this course I'm going to show you how you can use compute shaders in Unity.
[00:00:21.000-->00:00:26.000]在本课程中，我将向您展示如何在Unity中使用计算着色器。

[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   We'll start with super simple steps so you have a real grounding in the basics of the technology.
[00:00:26.000-->00:00:32.000]我们将从超级简单的步骤开始，这样你就可以真正掌握技术的基础知识。

[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Compute shaders in Unity started with DirectX and so if like me you're working on a Mac you may have heard that they only work on Windows.
[00:00:32.000-->00:00:36.000]Unity中的计算着色器从DirectX开始，所以如果你像我一样在Mac上工作，你可能听说它们只在Windows上工作。

[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I can assure you that's not the case.
[00:00:41.000-->00:00:44.000]我可以向你保证事实并非如此。

[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   This demo that you're looking at now is running on an iMac.
[00:00:44.000-->00:00:48.000]您现在看到的演示正在iMac上运行。


[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It works because Unity compiles the code we've written using the shading language HLSL into code that will run on Windows using DirectX or on a Mac using Metal, the graphics API used by iOS and Mac OS.
[00:00:48.000-->00:00:54.000]它之所以有效，是因为Unity将我们使用着色语言HLSL编写的代码编译为将在使用DirectX的Windows上运行的代码，或在使用Metal的Mac上运行的程序，Metal是iOS和Mac OS使用的图形API。

[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   But my job in this video is to whet your appetite to want to learn this stuff.
[00:01:04.000-->00:01:09.000]但我在这段视频中的工作是激发你学习这些东西的欲望。

[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Well how about this? Or this?
[00:01:09.000-->00:01.12.000]那么这个怎么样？还是这个？

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Before you get to that, in this and the next section we're going to start simple.
[00:01:12.000-->00:01:17.000]在开始之前，在本节和下一节中，我们将从简单开始。


[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Once you have the basics under your belt in section 2,we'll move on to post-processing techniques like this or this in section 3.
[00:01:17.000-->00:01:21.000]一旦你掌握了第2节中的基础知识，我们将在第3节中继续介绍像这样的后处理技术。

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Games often use particle effects and in section 4 we'll look at using compute shaders to render these effects, and we'll move on to look at flocking techniques perfectly suited to using compute shaders.
[00:01:27.000-->00:01:34.000]游戏通常使用粒子效果，在第4节中，我们将研究使用计算着色器渲染这些效果，然后我们将继续研究非常适合使用计算着色器的群集技术。


[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Section 5 takes on a serious challenge creating a physics engine that runs on the GPU.
[00:01:40000-->00:01:47.000]第5节提出了一个严峻的挑战，即创建一个在GPU上运行的物理引擎。


[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   In section 6 we look at using compute shaders to bend grass in a virtual breeze and finally in section 7 we look at the complex subject of fluids.
[00:01:47.000-->00:01:53.000]在第6节中，我们将介绍如何使用计算着色器在虚拟微风中弯曲草地，最后在第7节中，将介绍流体这一复杂主题。

[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I recommend you do the many challenges in the course. They'll greatly help your understanding.
[00:01:58.000-->00:02:04.000]我建议你完成课程中的许多挑战。它们将极大地帮助你理解。


[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Every serious Unity developer should understand compute shaders.
[00:02:04.000-->00:02:09.000]每个认真的Unity开发人员都应该了解计算着色器。


[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   They can massively improve the performance of your games.
[00:02:09.000-->00:02:13.000]它们可以大大提高游戏的性能。


[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So what are you waiting for? In the next video you'll create your first compute shader.
[00:02:13.000-->00:02:18.000]那你还在等什么？在下一个视频中，您将创建第一个计算着色器。


[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Catch you in a minute!
[00:02:18.000-->00:02:2000]一会儿见！


# P2.-004-Your-first-compute-shader

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.080]   your first compute shader
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   in this video you're going to create your first compute shader.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.440]   it's time to download the resources for the course.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.920]   you've got two options for this, if you're on a desktop computer.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.560]   then you'll see a sidebar at the right and you'll see a resources button.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280]   press this and the drop-down will show the file
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.440]   unity-compute-shaders.zip download
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   unzip and use unity hub to add the two new projects
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.080]   notice there is a complete and a start project
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.080]   if you work along with the course you should open the start project
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.400]   but if you get stuck then the complete project has the final version of each
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.320]   scene, script and shader
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.160]   if you prefer there is a github version of the resources
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.880]   at this address. Personally I recommend using the github version
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.960]   by cloning the repository using a git client such as github desktop
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   that way you can use version control as you make your own changes
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.360]   if you're unfamiliar with using git for version control
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.880]   then here's a useful tutorial. I recommend pausing the video now
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.080]   downloading the resources either via the udemy link
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.360]   or via github, adding the projects using unity hub
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   and opening the start project. Just a quick warning that you're likely to get
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.760]   loads of errors in the console when unity rebuilds its database
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.200]   just clear them when the import is complete so pause now and
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   come back when you're looking at the start project
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.120]   Hi, I promise you'll only have to do that once
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.000]   now navigate to the scenes folder and open the scene first compute shader
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.760]   in this first shader we're going to add a single quad object
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.240]   switch the camera to orthographic, size the camera
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.640]   and the quad so it fills the screen then set up a script that will allow us to
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400]   use a compute shader
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.480]   to overwrite the texture on the quad and finally create a compute shader that does
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.640]   the real work
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.240]   okay let's take this one step at a time
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.880]   step one use the right mouse button over the hierarchy window
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.920]   to open the context menu select 3d object
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.000]   quad. Step two, change the scale to 4
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.120]   for each axis. Step three, change the camera to orthographic
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.200]   now things remain the same size regardless of the distance from the
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.840]   camera
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   change the size parameter to 1 and set the Y position to 0
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.560]   you should now have the quad fill in the game view
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.040]   step four we don't want to use any lighting in the render
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.400]   so drag the unlit texture material onto the quad
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.880]   you'll find it in the materials folder. Step five
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.280]   create a C# script and rename it
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.320]   assign texture. Step six, double-click it to launch your text editor
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.480]   usually visual studio we're going to add a couple of public properties
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.880]   enter public compute shader, shader
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.000]   public int text resolution
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   equals 256 and we'll also need some private properties so add
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.680]   renderer end, render texture
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.000]   output texture, int kernel handle
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.280]   in the start method add this code
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.080]   output texture equals new render texture
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.400]   text resolution, text resolution 0
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.440]   output texture dot enable random write
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.960]   equals true, output texture dot create
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.160]   rend equals get component
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   renderer, rend dot enabled equals true
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.340]   here we create a render texture that is sized based on the text resolution value
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.280]   that is user-updatable via the inspector panel. The parameters are the width,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.000]   height and depth buffer bit depth so here the texture has no depth buffer
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.680]   it can be 16 or 24 if you're using a stencil
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.920]   setting enable random write to true
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.400]   allows our compute shader to write to this texture
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.160]   miss that out and all your code will be for nothing
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.920]   even though you've initialized an instance of a render texture
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.680]   it's not available until you call the method create
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.160]   always a good idea to check the docs for these details
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.920]   as some can trip you up. Here the docs clearly state the hardware texture is
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.040]   not created simply by creating an instance
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   of a render texture. The next lines added created a variable reference to the
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.320]   renderer component
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.000]   and setting enables equals true ensures the mesh render is enabled
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.500]   even if a user has disabled it in the inspector panel
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.680]   now we have a texture we can write to
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.040]   and a renderer to allow us to update the quad's texture
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.880]   to use our new one. Always remember to save your work before switching back to
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.680]   unity
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.200]   now drag this script onto the quad. Step 7 we're going to add a compute shader
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.520]   in the shader folder right click and select create shader
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.680]   compute shader. Give it a name and drag it onto the quad script
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.000]   you just created as the shader instance. We're nearly there
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.660]   before we examine the shader we need to update the script
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.560]   step 8 in the assigned texture script we're going to add a new method
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   enter private void init shader
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.320]   kernel handle equals shader dot
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.720]   find kernel cs main shader
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.200]   dot set texture kernel handle result
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.520]   output texture rend material dot
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.100]   set texture underscore main text
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.440]   output texture. There's a lot going on there
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.160]   before we review this method let's add a couple more lines
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.540]   to call this function then run the program
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.520]   after running the program we'll take a long look at what's happening
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.240]   add another method private void dispatch shader
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.120]   in text int y shader dot dispatch
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.140]   kernel handle x y 1
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.200]   and in the init shader method add dispatch shader
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.440]   text resolution divided by 16 text resolution divided by 16
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.720]   the final bit of code we'll add goes in the update method
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.120]   add if input dot get key up
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.560]   key code dot u dispatch shader
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.000]   text resolution divided by 8 text resolution divided by 8
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.480]   now make sure to call init shader in the start method
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.520]   now let's run the program. There's a weird pattern in the bottom left corner
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.040]   now press the u key and the pattern is extended to fill the screen
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.680]   what went on there? In the next video we'll review the code
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.680]   and discover more about threads and thread groups

# P3.-005-Reviewing-your-first-compu


[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   [Music]
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Reviewing your first compute shader
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   In the previous video you created your first compute shader.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I promised we'd review the code so you understand how it all works.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And that's the purpose of this video.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   First, let's look at the shader script that Unity created for us.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   By the way, if you're cheating and using the complete version of the Unity project,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   then shame on you.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   In the complete version the shader is called 'supinskiTriangle.compute'.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   You'll see why in a minute.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   But seriously, you'll get more out of the course if you code along and do all the challenges and quizzes.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   There's no substitute for practice.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   OK, that's my last nag, promise.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   A compute shader is written using the shading language HLSL,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   High Level Shading Language.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   The syntax owes a lot to the C language.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   A compute shader contains one or more kernels.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   A kernel, as you know from the previous video,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   can be culled from a MonoBehaviour script by using the compute shader method 'dispatch'.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   All kernels need a pragma, followed by kernel,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and then the name of the function to cull.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Here you can see the pragma uses the name 'csMain',
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and you can see a few lines later the 'csMain' function.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   A kernel always takes the same parameter,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   a Uint3, a three-component vector of type, unsigned integer.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   The sv_dispatch_thread_id is a semantic informing the compiler how this parameter is intended to be used.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Semantics are used when data has passed between different stages of the rendering pipeline.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Notice above the 'csMain' function the line about the number of threads.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Here we're using 64 threads, 8 times 8 times 1.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Before we look into these threads, let's look at the code in the function.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   This shader has 'rwTexture2D' of type 'float4' called 'result'.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's a texture that you can write to as well as read.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   'rwReadWrite'
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Each pixel in the texture has the type 'float4'.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   A 'float4' is a vector property having four components.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   HLSL allows us to access vectors using the channel names 'xyzw' or 'rgba'.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   If you've never come across shader code before,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   you're going to be amazed at how convenient the language makes using vectors.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   But more about that in the next section.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   The line that assigns a pixel value is this line.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Notice that we use the syntax 'resultId.xy' and this is assigned a value using the 'float4' constructor.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   A 'float4' constructor is expecting four parameters.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Don't get too hung up on these parameters.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   They just result in a Sapinski triangle named after the Polish mathematician Wachlaw Sapinski.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Clearly someone at Unity thought it would be a nice idea.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   For our purposes it overcomplicates things, so go ahead and change the values to '1000'.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Now, running the program, you get a solid red screen.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Hopefully it's more obvious now that the first parameter is the red channel,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   the second the green, the third blue, and finally the last one is the alpha channel.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Since our material ignores any alpha channel, it's unimportant what value this contains.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   The system will ensure that each parameter is clamped between the values 0 and 1.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   '0000' will give a black screen, whereas '0100' is green.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You get the idea.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Understanding which pixel gets filled is a little more confusing, but well within your capabilities.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Remember we looked at the number of threads, and these use a multi-dimensional array.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Using the code 'num_threads881', the thread blocks will have 8 in the X and Y and just 1 in the Z.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The first iteration, when X, Y and Z are all 0, has a group ID of '000'.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   In the shader, 'id.xy' will vary from '00' through to '77'.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   When the group ID is '000', 'id.xy' will point at the lower left corner of the texture.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The multiple threads handle an 8x8 square of pixels in the lower left corner.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   When the group ID is '100', this will handle an 8x8 square of pixels starting at 8 pixels from the left at the bottom,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   whereas group ID '010' will handle an 8x8 square of pixels starting at 8 pixels from the bottom left.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   The important takeaway is the number of threads set in the compute shader is a block of threads that run simultaneously.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Depending how we are using these threads will dictate how many of the blocks we wish to use.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   For now we are focusing on filling the pixels in a texture, so it makes sense to have the threads in the X and Y directions.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   If the size of the texture is given by the variable 'textResolution', then how many of these groups do we need to use to fill the screen?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Pause the video now and think about it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   We are going to need 'textResolution' divided by 8 blocks in the X direction and the same in the Y direction.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   We trigger the code using the compute shader method 'dispatch'.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This takes four parameters, the kernel handle of the function we are calling in the shader,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and an integer value for the number of times to call it in the X, Y and Z.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   You might be wondering why Z can't be set to 0.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   If Z is 0 then you will get no blocks being called at all.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Think of the threads as having a position within a 3D box.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   To get called a thread needs to have a position in three dimensions.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Here we are using four groups in the X axis, two in the Y and three in the Z.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Every one of these groups will be called.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   A total of 4 times 2 times 3 equals 24 groups.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Instead we use 4, 2, 2, then 16 groups are called.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   If Z is 1, then 4 times 2 times 1 equals 8 groups are called.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But if the Z layer is 0, then 4 times 2 times 0 equals 0 groups are called.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Notice in the assigned texture script we initially call 'dispatch' using 'textResolution' divided by 16.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That is only half the number of blocks necessary to fill the pixels in the X and Y directions.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So we get red in the bottom left.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   When we press U we set the number of blocks to 'textResolution' divided by 8,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   ensuring we fill the screen.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   You've learnt a lot in this video.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You've created your first compute shader, used this to set the pixels in a texture,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and you've been introduced to thread groups.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   In the next video we'll take what you've learnt to start to draw simple shapes in the shader
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and look at using different kernels in the same shader.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   If you're already familiar with shaders, then you may wonder why we don't simply use a fragment shader.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   The answer is compute shaders lend themselves to a much higher degree of flexibility.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Bear with me, it's worth learning.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And once you've worked through these initial steps, you'll see why.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Grab yourself a drink, you deserve it.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   See you in a minute!

# P4.-006-Multiple-Kernels

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.640]   In this video we are going to look at creating a shader that has more than one kernel. To code along with the video open the scene "SolidColor" in the start project, basically where we ended up in the previous example. Only the script on the quad is now called "SolidColor.cs",and the compute shader this is using is called "SolidColor.compute".
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.160]   The first thing we are going to do is pass the texture resolution to the shader. In the shader add this code "int textResolution" and we will change the name of the kernel  to "SolidRed". Remember to change the pragma and the function name. 

If you run the program now you will get an error.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.360]   Switch to the SolidColor script. Add this public property. Public string kernel name
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.380]   equal "SolidRed". Then in the int shader method replace "csMain" with "kernelName"
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.360]   and add shader.setInt textResolution textResolution.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.520]   Now you have seen how a C# script can set variables in a compute shader using setTexture   and setInt. In the next section we will see other methods for passing data to the compute
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.120]   shader. Running the program now we are back to a red screen.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.520]   Now copy the pragma, paste it in below and change "SolidRed" to "SolidYellow". Then
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.120]   copy the "SolidRed" function, including the "numThreads" line and paste it in below.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.080]   Switch "SolidRed" to "SolidYellow" and switch the parameters to the "float4" constructor
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.000]   to what values. Pause now and edit it. Use the inspector to change the kernel name to
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.560]   "SolidYellow" and run the program. Give it a try.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.360]   Did it work? "SolidYellow" should be "1 1 0 1". Great work if it worked for you.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.240]   Now you see how easy it is to call different kernels in a compute shader. Let's add another.


[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.680]   Copy the "SolidYellow" pragma and paste it below changing the name to "SplitScreen". Then copy the function, paste below and change the name to "SplitScreen".
The aim is to split the screen into 4 quadrants, each filled with a different colour. 
Pause the video now and try this for yourself. 
You'll need to test the value of IDX and IDY against the value you calculate and set a different colour depending on the group ID value. Remember  ID is a Uint3 value given the group ID. How did it go?
My solution is int half res = text resolution shift right 1 result id.xy = float4 step half res idX step half res idY 0 1. 
Running the program now gives a split screen  with 4 coloured quadrants. 


Recall that the step function returns 1 if the second parameter  is greater or equal to the first and 0 otherwise. If you're unfamiliar with using greater than  greater than, the shift operator, this moves the bits in the variable to the right by the  number that follows this. Here we're moving them 1 bit to the right, the equivalent of  dividing by 2.
Suppose we have text resolution as 256, that in binary form is 1 followed  by 8 notes, moving the bits to the right we get 1 followed by 7 notes, which equals 128. 

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.600]   The remaining code is very straightforward, we're just checking the dispatch thread ID  of the current pass. 
This is calculated like this example.
supposing the group ID equals  20,10,0 and the thread ID is 4,5,0 and the number of threads we're using is 8 8 1, then the dispatch  thread ID equals 20 10 0 times 8 8 1 plus 450, the group ID times the number of threads plus  the thread ID, 20 times 8 plus 4, 10 times 8 plus 5, 0 times 1 plus 0. 
If half res is  128, then ID dot x, 164, is greater than half res, 164 is greater than 128 and ID dot y is less than half res, 85 is less than 128. The colour is therefore 1001 or red. Now you're  probably getting more familiar with using dispatch thread ID to define a position on our texture. 

[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.320]   Let's try to paint a circle in yellow on a black background. To set things up let's create a new kernel called circle. 
I recommend coming up with a function that returns 1 if the values for ID dot x and ID dot y are inside the circle and 0 if not, then use this value to colour the pixel. 
HLSL has a useful function length that returns the length of a vector. Pause  the video now and give it a try. 

It's fairly tricky if you're new to shaders so don't spend  above 10 minutes pondering it, but practice is crucial to learning to code shaders.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.000]   How did it go? My solution, and there are many others, is this. First I created the function I talked about. float_insertl float_to_pt float_radius return length_pt less than radius
question mark 1 colon 0. This gets a point and a radius, and if the length of PT is less  than radius it returns 1, if not it returns 0. PT is a float vector with two components. 

 If you think about this it's important that PT is in relation to the circle's centre.

The dispatch thread IDs start at the bottom left and increase to the top right if we use  ID dot xy to select which pixel we're filling with colour. I want the PT values to be in relation to the centre of the texture. My circle function is therefore int half res  equal text resolution shift right 1 float res equal int circle float 2 int 2 id dot xy minus  half res float text resolution shift right 2. Result id dot xy equals float 4 res res 0 1. We've seen using shift right to divide by 2 so the first line is obvious, so too   is the last line. res can either be 1 or 0 depending on the return value from the insertal  function. The middle line needs some explaining. 

All the insertal function does is test if   the length of a float vector is less than radius and return 1 if it is and 0 if it isn't.
If we're testing this position then the vector is longer than radius so 0 is returned, whereas for this vector it's less than radius so 1 is returned. 

The values of id dot xy range  between 0 0 which we used to set the pixel in the bottom left and 256 256 if text resolution  is the default value of 256 which is in the top right using the code in the shader.
 We need a point based on id dot xy but where the centre of the screen is 0 0. 
 
 If we subtract  half res from id dot xy we'll get points in the range plus or minus 1 to 8.    Now 0 0 is the centre of the screen as required.  
 Then we cast this int 2 to a float 2. 
 
 We want the  radius to be a quarter of the text resolution .so we shift the bits in the text resolution  2 bits to the right which is a divide by 2 followed by another divide by 2. In other words a divide by 4. Now the insertal function is working on a float 2 value where the coordinate
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.520]   space has the origin at the centre of the screen. Running the program results in a yellow   circle. Great work! In the next video I'm going to set you a challenge to draw a square
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.640]   in the middle of the texture in blue. See you in a minute.

# P5.-007-Challenge-Use-a-compute-sh
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800]   Challenge one. Use a compute shader to draw a single blue square in the middle of a quad.   That's your challenge.


[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.600]   As we saw in the previous video, HLSL has a useful function step() that takes two parameters.  
The first parameter is the edge. 
Let's call the second parameter x.
The return value from this function is this. 
You might find this useful.


[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600]   There's a template for this challenge.  Open the scene challenge one.

[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   The quad has the script challenge one on it,  and the shader is also called challenge one. You'll see comments in the script and the shader guiding what you need to do.
Ok, pause now and write the code.

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   How did you do? There's more than one solution to any problem, and if you succeeded in getting a blue square on the texture,  then that's an excellent result.

[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   My solution is this.
In the challenge one script I added  
int half res equals text resolution shift right one;
int quarter res equals text resolution shift right two;
vector four rect equals new vector four quarter res, quarter res, half res, half res;
shader dot set vector, rect, rect .
Remember for the rect vector, x, y is the bottom left corner, z is the width, and w the height.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.600]   We pass this to the shader using the set vector method. The vector is assumed to be vector four.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   Now in the shader we add this code to the int square function.
float_hors equals step rect.x pt.x , minus step rect.x plus rect.z pt.x ,
float_vert equals step rect.y pt.y , minus step rect.y plus rect.w pt.y ,
return hors times vert ;

[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   and this to the square kernel, float res equals int square float two id.xy rect;
and don't forget to declare the rect variable.

[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   If I run the program now I get the blue square required.


[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Let's review the code.

[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   Remember the return value for the step method is this.

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   With a text resolution of 1024; the values for the rect are 256, 256, 512, 512; The bottom left corner is at 256, 256; and the top right at 768, 768; width and height are both set to 512.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   If a point is at 260, 300; this should return 1 from the int square function;whereas 260, 200 should return 0; because y is less than the bottom left corner we've set.

[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   Let's check the code.  Suppose the point we're testing is 260, 300; this should return 1.
In the Hors calculation the first step function returns 1,  and the second step function returns 0. 1 minus 0 equals 1. The vert, the first step function returns 1, and the second step function returns 0.  Again 1.
So Hors times vert is 1 times 1, which is 1.
Perfect.

How about 260, 200?
This is below the square so should return 0.
With Hors the first step calculation returns 1, and the second one returns 0. 1 minus 0 is 1.
The vert calculation, the first step calculation returns 0.
and the second step calculation returns 0.
0 minus 0 is 0.
Hors times vert is 1 times 0, which is 0.
So that works.


[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   We can test to the left using 200, 260. and here we have these results. 0 times 1, again 0. 

[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   And testing to the right using 800, 260;  we get these results.
 0 times 1 equals 0. Again the correct result.

[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Finally we check a point above the square, 26800.  Here we have these results.  Hors times vert equals 1 times 0, which is 0.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   See how useful the step function can be.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   You've nearly completed this introductory section.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Just a short quiz, then on to more exploratory steps
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   with compute shaders.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   See you over in section 2.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   Keep up the good work.
